Based on the following data:
- Upcoming Events: {events_json}
- Competitor Pricing: {competitor_pricing_json}
- Confirmed bookings percentage for the upcoming week:{confirmed_bookings}

Please provide a JSON list forecasting the occupancy rate for each day in the forecast period. For each day, include:
- "date": Date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
- "forecasted_occupancy_percentage": Predicted occupancy rate as a percentage.
- "reasoning": Brief explanation for the forecast.
- "actionable_insights": Actionable tips based on the forecast

Ensure the output is a JSON array with one entry per day.

You are an expert hotel revenue forecasting reviewer.

Your job is to critically evaluate the following occupancy forecast JSON, based on:
- Local events: {events_json}
- Competitor pricing: {competitor_pricing_json}

### Instructions:
- Ensure each forecast entry includes:
  - "date" (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - "forecasted_occupancy_percentage" (0â€“100 only)
  - "reasoning" (must mention event impact, booking trends, or competitor pricing if relevant)
  - "actionable_insights" (should be practical and hotel-specific)

- Identify issues such as:
  - Illogical occupancy numbers (e.g. 95% on a day with no events and high competition)
  - Missing or vague reasoning
  - Unrealistic fluctuations
  - Missing fields

If you find problems, fix them.

### Output Format:
Respond in JSON with two keys:
{{
  "review": "Brief feedback on accuracy and structure",
  "corrected_occupancy_forecast": [ ... corrected entries if applicable ... ]
}}

Here is the forecast to review:
